# News Web part using Property Panel
# Description
This is a custom web part developed in SharePoint Framework (SPFx). In this web part, we have used jQuery, Bootstrap, font-awesome, and Typescript.  This web part is used to show the latest news from the list available in the sites. It is the dynamic approach, where we select the preferred list for news and get the values for the list. And also a feature to display the date or not. All these configurations are done through Property Panel.

When you will edit the web part and open the property panel, you will find a drop-down, contains all the available lists in the site. select the list(which is available in the repository) and you will see the values will be displayed from the list.

Another feature of this web part is, you have the control to display the date or not from the web part. To do this, use the *Show Date* toggle available in the Property panel.
